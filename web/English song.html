  <h1 style="color:aquamarine">Rhythm of the Rain</h1>
  <p style="color:snow">
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain<br>
Telling me just what a fool I've been<br>
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain<br>
And let me be along again<br>
Now the only girl I've ever loved has gone away<br>
Looking for a brand new start<br>
Little does she know that when she left that day<br>
Along with her she took my heart<br>
Rain please tell me now does that seem fair<br>
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care<br>
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away<br>
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain<br>
Telling me just what a fool I've been<br>
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain<br>
And let me be alone again<br>
The only girl I've ever loved has gone away<br>
Looking for a brand new start<br>
Little does she know that when she left that day<br>
Along with her she took my heart<br>
Rain won't you tell her that I love her so<br>
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow<br>
And rain in her heart<br>
And let the love we knew start to grow whoa whoa<br>
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain<br>
Telling me just what a fool I've been<br>
Oh I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain<br>
And let me be alone again<br>
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain<br>
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain<br>
